## Installation

JumpServer supports multiple installation methods to cater to diverse user scenarios and preferences:

See Docs: https://docs.jumpserver.org/zh/v3/

#### 1. Online
Ideal for users with internet access, this method involves downloading installation scripts or packages directly from the internet. It ensures easy access to the latest updates and dependencies during installation.

Quick installation of JumpServer in just two steps:

1. Prepare a 64-bit Linux host with at least 4 cores and 8 GB of RAM, which has internet access.
2. Execute the following command as the root user for one-click installation of JumpServer.

```sh
curl -sSL https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/releases/latest/download/quick_start.sh | bash
```

#### 2. Offline
Suited for environments without internet connectivity, this method allows users to download all necessary installation files and dependencies beforehand. It ensures seamless installation even in isolated or restricted network environments.

Download offline package: https://community.fit2cloud.com/#/products/jumpserver/downloads

#### 3. Kubernetes (K8s)
JumpServer supports installation on Kubernetes clusters. You can deploy JumpServer as containerized applications on Kubernetes, leveraging the scalability and management features of Kubernetes for running JumpServer.

#### 4. All-in-One
This method provides a simplified installation process where all components of JumpServer are installed on a single server or machine. It's suitable for small-scale deployments or testing purposes where separate component deployment is not required.

#### 5. Enterprise Edition Trial
JumpServer offers a trial version of its enterprise edition, allowing users to test out the enterprise features and functionalities before committing to a full deployment. This trial version typically comes with limited duration or features to provide a glimpse of the capabilities of the enterprise edition.

Each installation method caters to different use cases and deployment scenarios, offering flexibility and options for users based on their requirements and infrastructure setup.
