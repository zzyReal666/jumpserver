JumpServer is the world's first open-source Bastion Host and is licensed under the GPLv3. It is a 4A-compliant professional operation and maintenance security audit system.

JumpServer uses Python / Django for development, follows Web 2.0 specifications, and is equipped with an industry-leading Web Terminal solution that provides a beautiful user interface and great user experience

JumpServer adopts a distributed architecture to support multi-branch deployment across multiple cross-regional areas. The central node provides APIs, and login nodes are deployed in each branch. It can be scaled horizontally without concurrency restrictions.
